### üîó Integrate each Plugin together
While each plugin on itself provides a unique experience, the real power comes from integrating them together. For example:
- Use **NetSearch** together with **QuickStocks**, to access company-based bonuses for your research such as [???].
- On the other side **QuickStocks** can use **NetSearch** to create new products for your shops ([ChestShop](https://modrinth.com/plugin/chestshop) is supported!).
- Use **Grimoires** to create books that can be sold in your **QuickStocks** shops, or even profit from ancient data of **NetSearch** to utilize them in your writings.
